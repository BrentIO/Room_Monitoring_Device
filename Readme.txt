About
--------

The Room Monitoring Device (RMD) is designed to use low-cost hardware for monitoring the environment within a single room.  The hardware uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU v3
to control 4 hardware devices: a standard LED, passive infrared sensor, ambient light sensor, and a temperature/humidity/pressure sensor.

The RMD sends data to an MQTT server for listening applications.  It can also receive data from an MQTT request.

Device Provisioning
---------------------

After flashing the sketch to the Arduino, RMD starts as an access point and web server.  The access point name will be RMD-[MAC].  The hardware address will have no spaces,
dashes, or colons.

Connect to the RMD-[MAC] access point then point a browser to http://192.168.1.1.  The provisioning page will display for the intermediate SSID, WPA key, and a URL for the
RMD to connec to and read a bootstrap file.  The bootstrap file defines the device's settings.

When specifying the bootstrap URL, you must use a fully-qualified domain name or IP address.

The bootstrap file is a JSON document which defines the settings that the device should use.  It may or may not be the same SSID and key that were defined in the fields
on the device provisining screen.

An example bootstrap JSON:

    {
        "SSID": "MyWiFi",
        "wpaKey": "SuperStrongWifiPassW0rd!",
        "mqtt": {
            "server": "myMQTTServer.local",
            "port": 1883
        }
    }

Upon clicking the "Provision" button, the device will return "OK" on the web browser.  The best indication a user will have of a successful provisioning will be the
disappearance of the RMD-[MAC] WiFi network.

If provisioning is successful, the device will reboot and begin to transmit MQTT messages with the measurements from the peripherals.

If provisining is unsuccessful, the device will fall back to the device provisining screen and prompt the user for information again.  The infrastructure access point and
web server are restarted.


MQTT Topics
--------------

There is one inbound MQTT topic and two outbound MQTT topics.  The inbound topic is /manage/ and the two outbound topics are /client/ for non-sensor information and 
/sensor/ for sensor data.

An example MQTT topic name for a device with a hardware address of AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF would be /manage/AABBCCDDEEFF/status.


 == Inbound ==
 The inbound MQTT topic is /manage/[MAC]/[Command], where [MAC] is the hardware address without spaces, dashes, or colons; [Command] is a command that the device will
 respond to, if the command is known.

 >> Commands <<
 The device understands certain commands when posted to an MQTT topic.  The only topic which the device subscribes to is /manage/[MAC]/#.  Responses to commands are sent
 to the /client/[MAC]/[Command] topic.


    /status
        Requests the status of the device, similar to a heartbeat.  If the device is responsive, it will send "OK" to the outbound /client/[MAC]/status topic.  No inbound
        payload is required to render a response, and any payload will be ignored.

    /uptime
        Requests the number of milliseconds (mills) that the device has been active.  If the device is responsive, it will a long integer value to the outbound 
        /client/[MAC]/uptime topic.  No inbound payload is required to render a response, and any payload will be ignored. 

    /provisionReset
        Requests the RMD to reset to sketch defaults and remove all settings, similar to a factory reset.  If the device is responsive, it will send a message on the
        topic /client/[MAC]/status with a payload of "provisionReset" and on the /client/[MAC]/restart topic with a payload of "OK".  An inbound payload of "request", case
        insensitive, is required to take the action.  Any other payload will be ignored and the action will not be taken.
    
    /restart
        Requests the RMD to perform a soft reset.  If the device is responsive, it will send a message on the topic /client/[MAC]/restart topic with a payload of "OK".  An
        inbound payload of "request", case insensitive, is required to take the action.  Any other payload will be ignored and the action will not be taken.
        
    /onboardLED
        Sets the on-board LED to be on, off, or to blink modes.  It can also be used to get the status of the onboard LED mode.  If the device is responsive, it will send
        a message on the topic /client/[MAC]/onboardLED with the current mode.  Four inbound payloads are supported, case insensitive: "on", "off", "blink", and an empty
        payload.  An empty payload is equivalent to simply requesting the current mode.
        
 == Outbound ==

 >>Sensor<<
 All sensor output is sent to the /sensor/[MAC]/[Peripheral] topic.  Sensor data is read once every 5 seconds, except motion, which is read with each loop because the sensor
 includes its own timer.  Note that the on-board LED is not considered a sensor and will not post data to the sensor topic.

 Each peripheral will output its own sensor data on the topic with the payload inclusive of its most current reading.  There is a minimum delta between the last reported
 observation and the current observation that must be met in order for the peripheral to output data.  By default, all peripherals will report on a restart.

 The peripherals supported are:
    /temperature
        The observed temperature in celcius with two digits of precision (XX.YY).

    /humidity
        The observed humidity as a percentage with two digits of precision (XX.YY).

    /pressure
        The observed atmospheric pressure in inches of mercury with two digits of precision (XX.YY).

    /luminance
        The observed light intensity in lux as whole integer (XX).

    /motion
        Motion activity where 0 = no motion reported and 1 = motion detected.  Motion will continue to be reported as 1 as long as motion is present plus
        approximately 2 seconds.

 >>Client<<
 Information about the device itself is output to the /client/[MAC]/[Command] topic.  This topic is the response to all /manage requests.

 The topics that are output are:
    /status
        The status of the device and related messages about device health.  Payloads supported: "started", which will trigger on each device restart indicating the RMD
        is connected successfully to MQTT; "OK", for a solicited heartbeat update; "provisionReset", a confirmation that the provisioning has been reset; 
        "Unable to Find Sensor BME280 Disabling Peripherals", indicating a hardware failure where the atmospheric sensor is not responsive.

    /restart
        Payloads supported: "OK", A notification that the device soft restart has been received and will be attempted.

    /uptime
        The number of milliseconds the device has been active.  Payloads supported: varies, as a data type long.

    /onboardLED
        Returns the status of the on-board LED setting.  Payloads supported: "on", indicating the LED is currently illuminated; "off", indicating the LED is not illuminated;
        "blink", indicating the LED is blinking on and off at a repeated interval; "disabled", indicating a hardware failure.
